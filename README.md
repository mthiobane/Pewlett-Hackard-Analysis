# Summary:
With this analysis we have been able to define the teams that are more affected by the “silver tsunami”, it shows that there is a lot of employees close to retirement and recruitment need to be done urgently to replace them specially in the Senior Engineer team and senior staff.
We could add the salaries of the retiring employer in order to know the amount that the company will save by recruiting new employee with less experience at ta lower salary.
The mentorship query will help to define how to link the new employee the one close to retirement.
To prepare the future we could also establish a query in order to determine retirement is the next 5 years.
